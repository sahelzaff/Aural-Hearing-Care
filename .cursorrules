# Cursor Rules for Aural Hearing Care Project

## UI and Functionality Preservation
- Do not modify or change existing UI elements, styling, or animations unless explicitly instructed
- Preserve all existing functionality and behavior unless changes are specifically requested
- Maintain the current design system, color scheme, and component structure
- Do not remove decorative elements, animations, or transitions without approval
- When fixing bugs, make minimal changes necessary to resolve the issue without altering design

## Implementation Guidelines
- Focus on fixing bugs and implementing requested features without changing existing code unnecessarily
- Respect the current architecture and patterns used in the codebase
- When adding new features, match the style and approach of existing code
- Document any critical changes that might affect other parts of the application
- Test all changes thoroughly to ensure they don't break existing functionality

## Token and Authentication Handling
- Standardize on access_token as the primary authentication token
- Ensure proper SSR compatibility in all authentication-related code
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing token handling where possible
